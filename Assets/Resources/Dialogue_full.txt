Colin,"What... is going on?",
Anais,"Oh, hey Colin, thanks for coming! Are you ready to test out the obstacle course?",
Colin,"Since when were we doing an obstacle course?",
Anais,"Since we've been talking about it every club meeting.",
Colin,"You know I sleep through those.",
Anais,"Which is exactly why you should be the person to test it! We need to make sure it's not dangerous before we release it to the public.",
Colin,"So you thought, 'have the Canadian do it, he'll never sue,' eh?",
Anais,"I'll stop telling Canadian jokes for a month.",
Colin,"You don't know any Canadian jokes.",
JON appears.
Jon,"I know Canadian jokes!",
Colin,"Ugh! What are you doing here?",
Jon,"Ana texted me to help. I see you crawled out of your igloo today. Good job.",
Colin,"...",
Jon,"Did you eat your cereal dry again? I keep telling you, we sell our milk in cartons.",
Colin,"...",
Jon,"Did your moose get a flat on the way over?",
Colin,"I was hoping for some more original content this week, Jon.",

Colin,"What's American hockey?",
Jon,"It- It-",
Anais,"Colin won that one, Jon.",
Jon,"Give me five minutes to think of a comeback. I'll see you downfield, muchacho.",
Anais,"So are you gonna try the obstacle course? I brought Canadisc!",
Colin,"... That's not Canadisc. That's just a disc with a heart on it.",
Anais,"Are you sure this isn't Canadisc? What about it does not accurately represent your country?",
Colin,"Okay. I'll give you that one.",
Anais,"Starting line is over here!",
Transition to: Starting line
Anais,"So you know how this works, right?",
Colin,"Are those desks?",
Anais,"Obstacles. I'm going to throw the disc downfield and you gotta catch it in the end zone. Avoid the obstacles and other flying discs.",
Colin,"Wait. Jon's going to be throwing those discs at me?",
Anais,"If you had been AWAKE during meetings you would have known it was part of the plan.",
Jon,"Hey, are you still waiting for the glaciers to melt?",
Anais,"Ready?",
Colin,"Let's get this over with.",
